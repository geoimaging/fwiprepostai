- Steps to run notebooks:
  1) Install all the requirements in requirements.txt
  2) Download the folder 'data' from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vjlRO7hp6bSu-4H1NwrhKH8qGjo5GSHz?usp=sharing). This folder contains the model weights, selected raw field data files, and a subset of the simulated testing dataset.
  3) Ensure that the data folder, the fwiprepostai directory, and the notebooks are located within the same parent directory.
